### 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer deeply in love with computer science. I enjoy building projects, learning new technologies, and collaborating with the open-source community.
It doesn't really matter to me what I write in, but I love Ruby and Rust the most. Rust is purely a hobby. I also don't write much in Go.
